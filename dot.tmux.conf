# Key repeat is annoying, when you hit a shell and then up-arrow, what to do?
# no -r, so no repeat, or maybe it's the other arrows?
# bind-key Up select-pane -U
set-option repeat-time 200

# Exit server when client goes away
set-option exit-unattached on

# Make copy-mode be like vim
set mode-keys vi

# Faster switching between panes
bind-key -n C-j select-pane -D
bind-key -n C-k select-pane -U
bind-key -n C-h select-pane -L
# prob only need j and h? so c-k can still mean kill... but I never use
